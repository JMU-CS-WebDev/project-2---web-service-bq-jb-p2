1. I was able to reach the /report.html endpoint, but the others 'do not exist on the webserver'. When trying to curl the node server, I cannot log in as its saying creds are not an authorized user.
2. I think the service is incredible useful.
3. The path's chosen are very similar to the ones my group made, so obviously I like them, I would have liked to have an endpoint that dumbped all current info.
4. I couldn't see these because I couldn't make CURL requests :/
5. Theres actually very little difference between ours and theirs, besides type of data being tracked. 
6. Yes ( no comments but, us either)
7. Not any past not being able to access the node server.
8. I think having a page that will dump all json information without requesting anything could be helpful for errorchecking moving forward.
