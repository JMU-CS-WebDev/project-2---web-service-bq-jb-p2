1. My connection was refused on port 8443, 443, 5000, etc so I was unable to reach any endpoints.
2. I liked the idea of a database of movies, since I couldn't really access the endpoints I don't really have
much to say about it.
3. All the path names look good and seem very reasonable and consistent.
4. The responses look fine as far as I can tell, maybe could use a little more information when using POST or DELETE
for when you build a client.
5. I feel like my service would be a little easier to build a client for because it provides a bit more interaction with
the database.
6. The code is structured great. It's readable and makes sense.
7. I haven't been able to look for any other issues since I cannot reach the server.
8. I would consider adding another GET endpoint to fetch individual items from the database.
