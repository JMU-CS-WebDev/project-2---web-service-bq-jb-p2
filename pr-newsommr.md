Were you able to reach their endpoint on the web?
- I do not know if it was an issue with my end but I could not establish a connection to their endpoints. I tried project2.jacksonsblog.me and project2.brandonq.me. I tried accessing
- using the standard ports (5000, 8443), trying http and https. None of the endpoints seem to reach for me but the report.html file did. Because of this I just looked through
- the code on github and it looks really good. The report indicated that all the CRUD operations were working for you when accessing the service. Based on the SQL and server.js file, there doesn't
- seem the be any obvious flaws but I wouldn't be able to know for sure without accessing the endpoints myself.
What did you like about this service?
- I think it is a unique idea creating a database for netflix recommendations and will be awesome with a front end to make it more accessible to users.
What do you think about the paths that have been chosen?
- This service did a better job then we did with our paths. This service has a different path for the different CRUD operations which makes it much more readable. They are clearly indicating what operation performs what.
What do you like about the structure of the responses from the different endpoints?
- They are all responding with JSON and in the event of an error, it is responding with a 404 or 500 which is good.
Describe one significant difference between your own P2 seervice and this person's. E.g.
- We have two get operations that can return all of our data or just the data that is requested while this service you can request a movie or a show but there is no get operation for all.
Which might be easier to build a front end for (and why)?
- I think ours might be a little easier because we have less data to keep track of in our SQL table.
Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
- I think both codebases will be well maintained. I do not see any issues with how either of our repos are being handled.
Is the code well-structured?
- The code inside the .js file is well structured and easy to read.
Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
- I would suggest creating folders in your repo to make it more clean and easier to follow.
- Also there are notes.txt and commands.txt files that might be better as one text file or maybe even just put that information in the report.html.
Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
- I do not think you have too little or too much to handle for when you create the frontend.
